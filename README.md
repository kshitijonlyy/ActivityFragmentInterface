# ActivityFragmentInterface
 
The launcher activity has 2 fragment container views via which we have attached two fragments. The activity has three buttons 'Red', 'Green' and 'Blue' using which we can change the color of the fragments.

The first fragment has a button which when clicked will change the color of the second fragment.
